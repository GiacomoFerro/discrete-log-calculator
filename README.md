In the src folder there are:

**discrete_log_problem** folder: 

A program in C that can calculate cyclic/non cyclic group ad the cyclic generator. So it calculates the exponent i s.t a=g^i starting from the seed 'g' of the group. After this, it calculates legendre and jacobi symbols.

  -**mylib.h** = contains all the functions used.

  -**dlog.c** = it's the main module.

  -**dlog** = executable program.
